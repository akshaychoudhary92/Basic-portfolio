	<div><h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Akshay Choudhary is a student who is currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. He lives in Snellville, Ga and is a life long student. Coding is something he always wanted to do and has been in and out of it for a while. He went to Georgia State for two years but could not complete his degree due to financial problems.
