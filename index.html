		<p class="p1">Akshay Choudhary is a student who is currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. He lives in Snellville, Ga and is a life long student. Coding is something he always wanted to do and has been in and out of it for a while. He went to Georgia State for two years but could not complete his degree due to financial problems. He worked at his dad's store for the next three years and saved up money to finally get back in the IT world. So far he has experiance in HTML and CSS and he is learning javaScript.</p>
